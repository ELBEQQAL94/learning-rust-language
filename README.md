# Learning Rust Language
-------------------------
* Currently at chapter 2: 
    - Bulding guessing game
    _ What i Learned from this chapter:
        * read user input:
            - use std::io; (import std library) 
            - io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        * create empty string: 
            - let empty_string = String::new()
        * match
        * enums
        * and more...
